# Canvas Course Exporter
A Python-based command-line utility to export a user's courses to their local filesystem.

## Dependencies
User must have Python 3 installed and must have the package `requests` installed. `requests` can be installed via pip by running `pip install` in the root directory of this project.

## Usage
This tool relies on two environmental variables: `CANVAS_ACCESS_TOKEN` and
`CANVAS_API_BASE`. The access token is documented [here](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.oauth.html#using-access-tokens), although the easiest way to obtain one is via Canvas's web interface under "Profile/Account" and "Settings", then selecting "+New Access Token". The API base is simply the base address you use to access Canvas's web interface, e.g. "https://school-name.instructure.com/". You can set both environmental variables in your shell, e.g.:
```sh
export CANVAS_ACCESS_TOKEN="0123456789"
export CANVAS_API_BASE="https://school-name.instructure.com/"
```

If you plan on using this tool often, you can add these commands to your `~/.bashrc`. Make sure you use `https` if your Canvas instance supports it, otherwise POST requests might be redirected to the secured version improperly.

Now you can start using the script. To list all of the courses available to you,
```sh
$ ./canvas-export.py --list
BIOL-101    Intro to Biology
PSYC-100    Intro to Pyschology
BIOL-101 Lab    Intro to Biology Lab Component
```

To export courses, list the ones you wish to export by code or id. Ids are exposed in the URL of a course's page through the Canvas web interface. You may need to surround course codes with quotes if they contain spaces or special characters.
```sh
$ ./canvas-export.py "BIOL-101 Lab" 100123

## Warnings
As noted in the [API documentation](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/), parts of the API, including the [Content Exports API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/content_exports.html#ContentExport) used here are still in beta and are subject to breaking changes.
